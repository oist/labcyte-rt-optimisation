Load and merge CAGE data
========================

Data from plates 1~3 and 4~6 were first loaded in separate CAGEexp objects
because our MOIRAI pipeline does not support dual indexing.  Here, we retreive
the objects and merge them.  Merging is relatively slow, so this workflow
just merges the `R` objects and saves the results to a file for further use
by other workflows.

```{r load_and_merge}
library("CAGEr")
ce1 <- readRDS("Labcyte-RT_Data_Analysis_3a.Rds")
ce2 <- readRDS("Labcyte-RT_Data_Analysis_3b.Rds")
ce  <- mergeCAGEsets(ce1, ce2)
saveRDS(ce, "Labcyte-RT_Data_Analysis_3.Rds")
```

```{r sessionInfor}
sessionInfo()
```
