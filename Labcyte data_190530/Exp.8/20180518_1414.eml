Dear Kato-san and St=C3=A9phane,

thank you for your feedback yesterday.

As you know, the processing of the current experiment will not be=20
finished today, since we have more reads (9 millions) and more libraries=20
(1,536).

Also, for the study of dNTP and Mg concentration, we need to prepare a=20
buffer without magnesium, and I also would like to add Mn2+.

Therefore, it is hard to finish the planning of this experiment by Monday=
.

I propose that next Monday we do the TSO/RT check with SuperScript IV=20
following exactly the same plan as for SSIII, and then on Thursday we=20
will do the dNTP/Mg/Mn experiment.

Other tests of trehalose and betain concentration, temperature checks,=20
etc are not essential.  Either we will not do them, or if you like we=20
can try to squeeze them on Friday (and freeze the RT products; I think=20
that it would not be a problem).

Cheers,

--=20
Charles
