Optimisation of reverse-transcription using the Labcyte Echo platform
=====================================================================

With the Labcyte Echo platforms, we generate a large number of combinations
of reaction parameters for reverse-transcription in a 384-well plate.  We
read the results by preparing nanoCAGE libraries of the cDNAs.

of principle on qPCR optimisation.
